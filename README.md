# PrivPrompt
This team has the purpose of ensuring data privacy is maintained in LLMs by identifying and obfuscating PII data; including the removal of names, emails, and SSNs from LLM prompts. Leveraging the use of artificial intelligence, we will develop a software called Priv Prompt that is open source and easy to integrate while maintaining utility and accuracy. This software will be a lightweight toolkit and API to preserve privacy of users and accuracy of LLM response. 

This project is completed as part of a bachelor's capstone project at Rochester Institute of Technology. 

We are guided by Faculty advisor Yidan Hu.
